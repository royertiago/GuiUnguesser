GuiUnguesser - Linux Version
============================

This repository is a Linux adaptation of the
[GuiUnguesser](https://github.com/ebonywolf/ProjGaia),
a graphical user interface for the
[unguesser](https://github.com/royertiago/unguesser).
(It should really work with any POSIX-compatible operating system
with recently enough C++ compiler and GNU Makefiles.)
