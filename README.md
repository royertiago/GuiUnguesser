=========

This is a program similar to [akinator](http://akinator.com/),
[20q](http://www.20q.net/) and [twentyquestions](http://twentyquestions.open-cs.net/).
You think of an entity, and the program will make you yes/no questions about it.
After the program have some of these questions answered,
it will make guesses about what you thought.

My aim is to make the program both capable of self-training
(add new entities and questions to the database)
and error-tolerant (tolerating a few wrong answers from the user).
